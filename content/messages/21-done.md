What a great show! Thanks to all who attended - together, we raised over $6000 today for The Trevor Project! We'll have a YouTube playlist next week up with all of the talks and live performances, but I'd like to remind everyone that you can still contribute to the giving campaign [here](https://dsrt.club/give) or [buy a shirt](https://dsrt.club/swag), where all proceeds will go to the charity. You've only got a week to order before we close the orders, so act soon.

If you'd like to watch the full replay on Twitch, [it's right here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1006104111).
