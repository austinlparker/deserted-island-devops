Like our New Horizons village, our community of applications interacts with each other, not just us. What kind of rules of polite society can we set for them so that we can all get along without fighting, and adapt well when someone moves out? When we talk about microservices, the implication is that it's something that we've built, but many of the same interaction rules can (and should?) be applied to our external tools.

This talk is for people who are working in an environment where the only constant is that tools will change and resources won't.
