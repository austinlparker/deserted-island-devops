bio: "Katy lives in Oakland, CA (but has lived in lots of places from East Coast to West Coast), and loves to experiment with technology. Over the years, she's been an editor, juice bar barista, IT technician, and farm hand, so she's learned to fail and try again in a lot of industries. Ask her about video game development, Russian Literature, Star Wars, or Dragon Age--she'll be your friend right away."

Communities and relationships affect how we work, why we work and what we work on, so it’s natural to feel unproductive or unmotivated at a time when they are at risk. Lets talk about productivity while working under quarantine, the risks and symptoms of burnout, and how we take care of ourselves in a uniquely difficult time. I’ll share some of my own strategies and open up discussion for others to share theirs as well. We’re all in this together!
