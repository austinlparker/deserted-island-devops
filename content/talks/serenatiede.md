Distributed tracing is a powerful observability tool, and its value becomes apparent when you have tons of services sending spans. You might be an engineer who has read the jaeger docs and understand conceptually what distributed tracing can do for you, but how do you get management on board to give you money and engineering time? How do you get your org’s APIs to take that initial plunge or getting your company’s platforms sending spans? If you’re asking yourself these questions, please come along on this adventure! The key takeaway is how to make a successful pitch for a shared service that makes engineers happy and leadership happy!
