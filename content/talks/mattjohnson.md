Cloud-native technologies and methodologies such as Kubernetes, infrastructure as code (IaC), and GitOps have drastically changed the way we build applications. The way we secure those applications needs to evolve as well.

We'll start with a pre-built, insecure deployment pipeline and work backwards to learn common Kubernetes security misconfigurations and how to prevent them through automated guardrails. The environment will be available to all attendees to follow along or deepdive for themselves after the session.
