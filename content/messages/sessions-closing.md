We've had some fun this summer, but like all good things, it's time for it to come to an end. We're going to do one last show from Animal Crossing, but it's one you won't want to miss! Join us for a beach party on August 28th - you can find out more about the speakers at our [sessions page](/sessions).

This will be our last formal event for 2020, so I hope everyone can attend!
