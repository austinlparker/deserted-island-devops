When we all went to our individual islands, the experience didn't look the same for everyone. Some had others on their islands while others only had their landlord and other villagers for company. Some of us lived on our islands long before others were forced to theirs. As we began to reconnect and our time on our islands lasted longer and longer, we had to review exactly how we would communicate. We could "visit", but it required coordination. We could send letters, but that took time. One thing we all needed to learn was how to work together, no matter which island we were on.

This talk will address:
* Different Asynchronous and Synchronous Channels
* How to Maximize Synchronous Communication
* Asynchronous Etiquette 
* The Remote Watercooler

This talk sets ground rules and expectations for fully distributed communication and collaboration. These general rules are good for any distributed team member to keep in mind.
