bio: "Kat Cosgrove is a Developer Advocate, a CNCF Ambassador, and an actual cyborg. Her professional background has run the gamut from bartender, to video store clerk, to teacher, to software engineer. She credits this wide-ranging experience for her success as a speaker, developer, and advocate. You can usually find her speaking about DevOps or cloud native technologies, particularly 101-level content, in pursuit of her goal of increasing accessibility for these tools.

When she's not building demos or at a conference, she spends her time playing video games, watching horror movies, and reading science fiction. She lives in Seattle with her cat, Espresso, who is the real brains behind the operation. Espresso may be ghostwriting her tweets."

Every company on the planet either has, or wants to have, a community. For many this is a marketing tool â€“ a source of free content generation, or word of mouth promotion, or simply repeat customers. In open source, the community plays a much more key role. The community is responsible not just for the aforementioned things, but also for the maintenance of the product and the happiness of end-users.

Without a healthy, active, and growing group of people donating their time, skills, and emotional energy to free of charge, the product might not exist. Ensuring that community flourishes means investing in fostering trust on both sides, and allowing a certain degree of autonomy. This can become very complicated to manage, though; people are messy, and perspectives will differ between the community and the business. How do we succeed here? How do we balance the will of the community and the needs of the business? And when differing perspectives clash (because they will), how do we manage the loss of trust and come out stronger for it?
