I spent 11 years in the Air Force and was medically separated in 2010. The past 12 years my career has been thriving while my mental health has gone in the opposite direction. It's not only tech behind my mental health issues. There is childhood trauma, military experience trauma, and some private sector career trauma in there too. Your mental health CAN be self sabotaging. But, this talk aims to pull you back from the brink and how to be kind to others going through tough times.
