Can you believe we're only a week away? Today we have a big announcement - our show will be kicking off with a performance by our special musical guest, [Sam Aaron](https://twitter.com/samaaron)! You won't want to miss this!

In addition, our sponsors for the year have been announced! Please check them out on the [sponsors](/sponsors) page and give them some love - you'll be able to learn more about them in the #sponsors channel in Discord during the event. They'll have some special offerings, exclusively for attendees of Deserted Island DevOps!

We're not done with announcements, either - stay tuned!
