Some adventures are fun and rewarding. Some (like 2020) are just exhausting. In order to keep on adventuring, it’s important to develop empathy, not only for your fellow adventurers, but also for yourself. Using tales from a year of running a remote Dungeons and Dragons campaign as a backdrop, this talk will cover practical strategies for practicing and leveling up your empathy. From character creation, we can learn how to be kind to ourselves and build individual resilience, even when the dice don’t roll our way. As we build up a balanced party well-set to brave some dungeons, we can look at ways to effectively interview and build stronger teams. And when we step back to look at the big picture story, we can learn valuable lessons for how to make the industry more inclusive and think about how the work we do affects the world around us.
