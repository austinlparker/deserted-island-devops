Missed Deserted Island DevOps? Don't worry, because you can catch all the talks [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVUQjiv8GtwL-B9AJJ-rNdiDtcU2wo7Gy)! I've also written up the experience of creating and producing this event on my blog, so [give it a read](https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/).

Until next time...
