# About
Ready to come back to the island?

## Information

Deserted Island Sessions is a continuation of what we started at Deserted Island DevOps earlier this year. Once again, it'll be a free event, streamed live on [twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe](https://twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe), but in a more "bite sized" format. Rather than a full-day event, we're shooting for multiple, smaller streams of at most a few hours. Each session will cover a particular topic -- everything from CI/CD, to Observability, to Kubernetes, Security, and much more.

## Registration

As before, this event will be entirely free to attend, and live streamed on Twitch. If you'd like to stay in touch and get the latest updates, please [register for our newsletter](/registration) and join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sz8pX42).
