What does software engineering and Animal Crossing have in common? Building happens in real time, so you need to be strategic in how you allocate your time. Should I be planting apple trees, or selling turnips? Should I be cost-optimizing these databases, or replacing that legacy infrastructure? This talk will present some strategies to set your engineering team up for success in a world where your time is as valuable as a gold nugget.
