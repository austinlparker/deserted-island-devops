bio: "Jacquie Grindrod is a developer advocate for HashiCorp where she’s able to apply her passion for solving problems with a holistic approach by bridging the gaps between teams and systems. From making making healthcare accessible to creating a winning networking application for women in tech at ElleHacks 2018, Jacquie works to collaborate and empower communities around her. In 2019, Jacquie was recognized as Canada's Top 30 Under 30 Developers and spoke at DevOpsDays Toronto. A notable ACNH moment for her was shouting 'Yay I finally paid off my house loan!' to which her partner promptly responded 'why do you even play this game??'"

When your application is mission critical, DevOps can feel a lot like fixing a spaceship to go to space. It can be hard to get all the right pieces in the right places at the right time, & sometimes all you can do is take a step back and have a little fun with what you’ve learned. That’s how a software engineer & a devops practitioner who have neither been to space nor built a video game before found themselves swapping roles as well as building a game about making it to space to bring people together during a time of unprecedented virtualization. 

We’ll share our progress & mistakes made as well as some of the highs & lows of our game development foray (featuring challenging moments such as “why is it green in my terminal and pink in yours??” & “what are tilesets and why are they so hard?!”) 

Topics you can expect to hear in this talk:
* XKCD’s “You Will Not Go to Space Today” as a metaphor for devops
* Prototyping jump start vs learn-as-you-go development
* Raft in a Game for dynamic room generation and scaling
* DevOps concepts applied to (amateur) game design 
* Some things we used: Godotengine & GDScript, Go & termbox, Jenkins-X, AWS, Nomad, Consul, Vault, Terraform
