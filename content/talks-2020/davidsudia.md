Or, how the real-time nature of Animal Crossing informs DevOps practices.

The current DevOps ecosystem is moving incredibly fast, and I've found that because of that it often pays to...slow down. You can start building off that cool new tool now, or wait until there's a one-command CLI to deploy the whole thing for you. 

Of course, sometimes you need feature X right now and can't wait, in which case, get going!

I've learned this lesson over and over in the last three years of working in the Cloud Native ecosystem and would like to share my experience of when it's been worth being an early adopter, and when, like planting those non-native fruits instead of immediately selling them for those sweet, sweet bells, it's worth waiting.
