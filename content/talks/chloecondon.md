bio: "Chloe is a Bay Area based Cloud Advocate for Microsoft. Previously, she worked at Sentry.io where she created the award winning Sentry Scouts program (a camp themed meet-up ft. patches, sâ€™mores, giant squirrel costumes, and hot chocolate), and was featured in the Grace Hopper Conference 2018 gallery featuring 15 influential women in STEM by AnitaB.org. Her projects and work with Azure have ranged from fake boyfriend alerts to Mario Kart 'astrology', and have been featured in VICE, The New York Times, as well as SmashMouth's Twitter account. Chloe holds a BA in Drama from San Francisco State University and is a graduate of Hackbright Academy. She prides herself on being a non-traditional background engineer, and is likely one of the only engineers who has played an ogre, crayon, and the back-end of a cow on a professional stage. She hopes to bring more artists into tech, and more engineers into the arts."

As a person who made a career transition from musical theatre to the world of tech, there have been a lot of shiny tools, processes, and buzzwords, that my brain has had to absorb and adjust to. While some have been more difficult to adapt to than others (I'll take an audition over whiteboarding ANY day!), I've discovered that as a human with ADHD applying DevOps to my day to day life has helped made me a more reliable, agile, and collaborative human. In this keynote, I'll share some ways that I've applied DevOps to my day to day life, relationship, and mental health practices to make sure that I am better able to evolve, improve, and be a more reliable human.
