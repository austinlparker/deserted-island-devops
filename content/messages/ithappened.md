We had over 8500 unique viewers yesterday, which is quite frankly completely unreasonable for an event that started as a bit on Twitter. I'm going to turn around the individual talks into separate videos and host them on YouTube this weekend, but I really do want to say thank you to everyone who attended. I'd also like to thank our [speakers](/agenda) and [sponsors](/sponsors) for helping make this possible. Finally, a huge shout-out to our volunteer moderators who kept chat flowing smoothly (even if the bot was a bit overzealous at times!).

For those who asked, and many did, I'll be writing up how this all worked next week and I'll post it somewhere. I'll update this page once the postmortems happen.

Again, and I cannot express this enough - thank you for showing up. We accomplished something really special yesterday. Stay safe. Remember, you've got a friend in all of us.
