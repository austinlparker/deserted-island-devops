At its core, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game about building a community — literally — on a remote island. Right now, many of us are also experiencing our own version of remote living, though luckily with many of life’s modern conveniences. Without in-person events, meetups, and interactions, it’s crucial to create or maintain digital spaces for developer communities.

This talk will explore converting a face-to-face community to a virtual community, a few tools (like Twitch) you can use, and how to be a good citizen of these communities. You’ll leave with a few examples to hopefully inspire you and an answer to the all-important question — how is community building like Animal Crossing?
