type: talk
bio: "Katy lives in Oakland, CA (but has lived in lots of places from East Coast to West Coast), and loves to experiment with technology. Over the years, she's been an editor, juice bar barista, IT technician, and farm hand, so she's learned to fail and try again in a lot of industries. Ask her about video game development, Russian Literature, Star Wars, or Dragon Age--she'll be your friend right away."
