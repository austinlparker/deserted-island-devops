Thank you to everyone that attended and watched! Together, we raised over $2200
for The Trevor Project. Recordings of all of the talks are available [on our
YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVUQjiv8GtwJeezuKvmL2kl6I9Gml0g2a). 

I'd like to thank everyone who's been a part of Deserted Island DevOps over the
years. We'll be taking the event in a slightly different direction in 2023, so
please stay tuned for more information by following us on Twitter @DIDevOps.

Remember, it's not goodbye, it's see you again soon.
