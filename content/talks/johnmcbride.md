Team knowledge, configurations, and infrastructure access can be challenging in a distributed world. Have you ever asked "what's that command we use?" or "Where are the secrets to access that environment?" - well this talk is for you!

We'll explore using Oh-My-Zsh, a powerful Zsh configuration framework, in order to share team knowledge, distribute common configurations, and share infrastructure access. We'll discuss the real world scenario this use case emerged from, challenges faced in this approach, and how you can leverage Oh-My-Zsh for your distributed devops teams.
