Observability helps engineers understand the systems they have built, but it can also help engineers new to your team and even engineers new to tech understand the systems they will be working on. 

In this talk, we will explore what it means to build a culture of observability within engineering teams, how a culture of observability fosters a culture of learning, and how these practices build a foundation to do things like onboard new engineers more effectively, help engineers level up, and take on apprentices.
