The CFP has closed and our speakers have been selected! We'll be announcing them over the next couple of days, so keep an eye out here or on your email for more info. 

I'm also happy to announce that this year, Deserted Island DevOps will be streaming for charity! Since there's no registration fee, we'll be encouraging viewers to donate to [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/) during the stream. In addition, 100% of unused sponsor monies will be given to the charity.
