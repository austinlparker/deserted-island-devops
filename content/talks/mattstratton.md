We know that DevOps is about people, empathy, relationships, and collaboration. And science supports that—studies have shown collaboration is critical to effective software development and software operations. But many times, collaboration is easier said than done. Which begs the question: How do we deal with people and learn to work with different personalities? 

Don’t worry, we can learn to improve our human interactions. Over time, I’ve learned some techniques and approaches to enhance collaboration and interaction, which I’ll share so you can put them into practice yourself! 

Topics covered in this talk include:
- De-escalating conflict
- Facilitating blameless meetings
- Reframing conversations to be more productive
- Encouraging psychological safety in teams
