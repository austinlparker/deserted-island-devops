As a free, community-run event, Deserted Island DevOps does not accept sponsors or vendor pitches in its talks. However, we do gladly accept promotional support from companies who believe in our mission of doing weird stuff and providing a platform for DevOps practicioners. We don't expect financial compensation, just promotion.

If you'd like to discuss this with the organizers, please email info at desertedisland.club.
