Fatima and Daniel, BFFs IRL and island neighbors, talk about their journey into DevOps starting from 0. Let‚Äôs face it, DevOps is intimidating - there are so many moving pieces that are constantly changing. It can be overwhelming to understand the technical concepts, interact with niche communities, and start building with all the cool new tech, especially if you‚Äôre new, much like building an island from scratch üå¥.

As newcomers to the DevOps community, Fatima and Daniel will share strategies for survival, the resources they used, and what they learned on the way. There‚Äôs an art to asking questions, connecting with the community, learning in public, and most importantly, building projects with Kubernetes. Yes, there is a wrong way to build with Kubernetes üôÉ. 

Join us for a wonderful, flower planting, fruit picking, and fossil collecting journey of professional growth and friendship, powered by DevOps & Turnips.
