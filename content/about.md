Deserted Island DevOps is a single-day virtual event, to be livestreamed on twitch.tv/desertedislandtv on April 30th, 2021. All presentations will take place in the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

As this is a community event that's free to attend, we encourage viewers or anyone that gets something out of the talks to make a donation to the conference's preferred charity, [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/). 

## History

Deserted Island DevOps started in 2020 with the goal of presenting a virtual conference that wasn't just another really long Zoom call. 

## How does it work for presenters?

Presenters will need a copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch. You'll be given a Dodo Code (along with up to 7 other co-presenters/audience members) that you'll use to connect to the designated island at a specified time. In addition, you'll dial into a Zoom call. The producers will be streaming both the ACNH island in addition to the slides being presented over the Zoom call to Twitch. It'll look something like the following:

Production will switch between the small version of the slides and a full-screen version so that the audience will be able to actually read the text. It'll look a lot like the video in this tweet!
