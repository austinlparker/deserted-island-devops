Have a task that’s supposed to be easy? You could do it in a snap? You know you really should get it done, and yet… you just can’t bring yourself to do it?

This talk presents the concept of the Wall of Awful, a metaphor for emotional barriers that keep us from doing the things we supposedly want to do, the neuroscience behind these blockers, and tactics for getting past them and to your goal.
