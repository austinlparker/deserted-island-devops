Deserted Island DevOps is a single-day virtual event, to be livestreamed on twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe on April 30th, 2020. All presentations will take place in the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

## What?

Seriously.

## Seriously, What?

Says what it is on the tin, bucko.

## You posted this on April 1st.

It's 100% legit.

## Ok, uh, how does this work?

Presenters will need a copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch. You'll be given a Dodo Code (along with up to 7 other co-presenters/audience members) that you'll use to connect to the designated island at a specified time. In addition, you'll dial into a Zoom call. The producers will be streaming both the ACNH island in addition to the slides being presented over the Zoom call to Twitch. It'll look something like the following:

Production will switch between the small version of the slides and a full-screen version so that the audience will be able to actually read the text.

## This is right up my alley!

If you're interested in this, please [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/austinlparker) to let me know. You can also register for the event [here](https://tinyletter.com/DesertedIslandDevOps)!

## When is this happening?

We'll go live on April 30th, 2020 at around 10 AM Eastern Time. The event will run until around 2 PM Eastern Time. There _will_ be a recording of the event, if you can't make it live.

## What sort of talks would you want to run?

Talks should be between 15 and 25 minutes, with or without slides. The usage of in-game props is encouraged, if possible. This event aims to highlight the creativity and playfulness of DevOps, but we're also absolutely OK with talks about tools as well. You should go a little wild -- I mean, it's a tech conference inside Animal Crossing. Get weird. More details about submitting a talk can be found at [our Call for Papers](https://sessionize.com/deserted-island-devops/) at Sessionize.

## Accessibility and Code of Conduct

We'll strive to provide closed captioning (machine translation) on the stream. Please find our [Code of Conduct](/coc) here.
