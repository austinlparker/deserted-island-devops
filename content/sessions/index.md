# Information

Deserted Island Sessions is a continuation of what we started at Deserted Island DevOps earlier this year. Once again, it'll be a free event, streamed live on [twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe](https://twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe), but in a more "bite sized" format. Rather than a full-day event, we're shooting for multiple, smaller streams of at most a few hours. Each session will cover a particular topic -- everything from CI/CD, to Observability, to Kubernetes, Security, and much more.

# Registration

As before, this event will be entirely free to attend, and live streamed on Twitch. If you'd like to stay in touch and get the latest updates, please [register for our newsletter](/registration) and join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sz8pX42).

# Call for Speakers

Would you like to be a part of Deserted Island Sessions? Got something to say? We'd love to have you! We'll be accepting proposals from speakers starting June 1st until the end of July, and they'll be evaluated on a rolling basis. 

# Sponsors

We're going to be exploring some new options for sponsorship this time around! If you're interested in becoming a sponsor, please [drop us a line](mailto:info@desertedisland.club) for more information.
