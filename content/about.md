Deserted Island DevOps is a single-day virtual event, to be livestreamed on twitch.tv/oncallmemaybe on April 30th, 2020. All presentations will take place in the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

## What?

Seriously.

## Seriously, What?

Says what it is on the tin, bucko.

## You posted this on April 1st.

It's 100% legit.

## Ok, uh, how does this work?

Presenters will need a copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch. You'll be given a Dodo Code (along with up to 7 other co-presenters/audience members) that you'll use to connect to the designated island at a specified time. In addition, you'll dial into a Zoom call. The producers will be streaming both the ACNH island in addition to the slides being presented over the Zoom call to Twitch. It'll look something like the following:

Production will switch between the small version of the slides and a full-screen version so that the audience will be able to actually read the text. It'll look a lot like the video in this tweet!
