We might have just spent the last year mastering the art of having the perfect flower field around our home, keeping the weeds out of our island, or just trying to build relationships with our neighbors. The skills and the lessons we’ve mastered through building our islands can also help us in real life, from staying connected to building stronger engineering teams and applications. Let’s take a moment to see the similarities of the work we’ve done on our islands, ourselves, workplaces, and celebrate all we’ve learned.
