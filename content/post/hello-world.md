Deserted Island DevOps is a single-day virtual event, to be livestreamed on twitch.tv at an upcoming date. All presentations will take place in the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

## What?

Seriously.

## Seriously, What?

Says what it is on the tin, bucko.

## Ok, uh, how does this work?

Presenters will need a copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the Nintendo Switch. You'll be given a Dodo Code (along with up to 7 other co-presenters/audience members) that you'll use to connect to the designated island at a specified time. In addition, you'll dial into a Zoom call. The producers will be streaming both the ACNH island in addition to the slides being presented over the Zoom call to Twitch. It'll look something like the following:

Production will switch between the small version of the slides and a full-screen version so that the audience will be able to actually read the text.

## This is right up my alley!

If you're interested in this, please [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/austinlparker) to let me know.

## What sort of talks would you want to run?

We're still figuring that out, but basically anything in the 'DevOps' field. Generally, I'm thinking that things should be on the shorter side (30 minutes including Q&A at the end), and pretty breezy. I mean, it's a DevOps conference inside Animal Crossing -- we're trying to have some fun here, y'know?

## Accessibility, Diversity, Inclusion, and Code of Conduct

Since this event is fully virtual, we should be able to provide (machine-assisted) closed captioning. Before we actually schedule this, a D&I and CoC will be posted on this site.
