We're excited to announce our keynote speakers for this year's event, as well as
the opening of registration!

First, we'd like to welcome [Kat Cosgrove](https://twitter.com/dixie3flatline)
and [Heidi Waterhouse](https://twitter.com/wiredferret) as our keynote speakers!
You'll be able to hear some never-before-seen talks from them to open the event
each day.

Second, we have some changes to our registration. While the main program will be
free as usual, we'll be offering a limited amount of paid registrations who will
receive exclusive access to the event, including:

- Conference T-Shirt
- Exclusive Speaker Panels
- Early Access to Event Recordings
- Custom Discord Role
- More!

Be sure to [register today](/registration) to get your ticket -- once they're gone, they're gone!
We'll be announcing our full list of speakers in the next couple of weeks, but I
can assure you, you won't want to miss this year's talks. See you in September!
